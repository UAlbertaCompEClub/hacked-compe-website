                <p class="9u faq-answer">
                    You have 24 hours to work on a project, which can be based on hardware, software, or a combination of both. During the event, there will be mentors from industry and student volunteers (as well as fellow participants!) to help troubleshoot when you get stuck, or inspire you when you’re out of ideas! After the 24 hours are up, you present your work to a panel of judges.

                <p class="9u faq-answer">
                    No! You can choose to work individually or in a team. We recommend having a group of three people but the maximum you can have is five. (PS: the prizes are best split between 3 people!)

                <p class="9u faq-answer">
                    Your laptop and charger are the most important things you should have with you! Besides those, you might want to bring a change of clothes, a pillow and a blanket if you want to be comfortable for your power naps.
